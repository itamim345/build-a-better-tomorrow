# Build A Better Tomorrow
## Introduction

In this very simple project, I have tried to make a beautiful landing page.

I focusd to practice some properties of Background image,Flex and Media queries (to make it mobile friendly or responsive in multiple screen).

I have used only HTML and CSS for this project.

It has taken 2-3 hrs to finish
